# Neural Differential Algebraic Equations


This is the repository for the paper titled **[Learning Neural Differential Algebraic Equations via Operator Splitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12938)** by James Koch, Madelyn Shapiro, Himanshu Sharma, Draguna Vrabie, and Jan Drgona.

Neural Differential Algebraic Equations (Neural DAEs) are an extension of the canonical neural timestepper for systems with algebraic constraints. 
Inspired by fractional-step methods, this work leverages sequential sub-tasks to provide updates for algebraic states and differential states.
